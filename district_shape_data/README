This directory contains instructions for extracting congressional district shape data.

First, upload "113th_U.S._Congress_House_districts_blank.svg" to a service like Ready Set Raphael: http://readysetraphael.com/

This will output javascript that include all the shapes of each congressional district as Raphael paths.

But we don't want all those shapes, and we don't want Raphael to draw them all at once. "Convert_data.py" scans that javascript file and extracts the paths of the specified states to a file called "convert_data_output.js." That file is the basis for "selected_cds.js" in the htdocs directory.

It's a rather roundabout way of getting the paths you want -- it would make more sense to have a script that extracts data directly from the .svg file itself instead of requiring the intermediate step of using Ready Set Raphael. However, this appeared the quickest solution at the time.
