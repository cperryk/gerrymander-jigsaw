The files here allow easy extraction of congressional district SVG paths to a javascript variable, filtering out unselected states.

First, upload "113th_U.S._Congress_House_districts_blank.svg" to a service like Ready Set Raphael: http://readysetraphael.com/

Ready Set Raphael will output javascript that include all the shapes of each congressional district as Raphael paths. Copy and paste that output into "congressional_districts.txt".

"Convert_data.py" scans that javascript file and extracts the paths of the specified states to a file called "convert_data_output.js."

That file is the basis for "selected_cds.js" in the htdocs directory.

It's a slightly roundabout solution, but an effective one!
